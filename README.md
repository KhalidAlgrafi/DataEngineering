# Data Modeling Project with dbt and Dagster

This project utilizes [dbt (data build tool)](https://www.getdbt.com/) for transforming data in our warehouse and [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) for orchestrating those dbt jobs and other tasks. The aim is to provide clear, reliable data models for analysis and decision-making processes.
